        <p>As we navigate the internet, it's easy to take for granted the complex series of events that occur behind the scenes when we type a URL into our browser and hit Enter. In this blog post, we'll explore the journey of a web request, specifically focusing on what happens when we type "https://www.google.com" into our browser's address bar.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>DNS Request:</strong>
                <p>The journey begins with a DNS (Domain Name System) request. When we type "https://www.google.com," our browser needs to find the IP address associated with the domain name "www.google.com." It sends a DNS query to a DNS resolver, which then recursively searches through a hierarchy of DNS servers until it finds the IP address associated with the domain.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>TCP/IP:</strong>
                <p>Once the IP address is resolved, the browser initiates a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection to the server at that IP address. TCP ensures reliable communication by establishing a connection-oriented protocol for data exchange. IP (Internet Protocol) then handles routing and delivery of packets between devices on the internet.</p>
